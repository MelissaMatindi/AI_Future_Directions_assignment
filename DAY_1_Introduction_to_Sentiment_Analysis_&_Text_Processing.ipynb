        "## **a) What is sentiment analysis?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Sentiment analysis is the use of NLP to identify, extract, and quantify subjective information — primarily the emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Text is unstructured; so sentiment turns it into actionable insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Applications in industry**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Brand Monitoring:** Companies track mentions on X/Twitter or Reddit. Example: Coca-Cola monitors real-time sentiment during ad campaigns to detect backlash early.\n",
        "* **Customer Feedback:** Amazon/e-commerce analyzes product reviews to prioritize improvements.\n",
        "* **Social Media Crisis Detection:** NGOs or social platforms flag rising negative sentiment in user posts as early distress signals.\n",
        "* **Market Research:** Political campaigns gauge public opinion on candidates from news/forums.\n",
        "* **Financial Trading:** Hedge funds analyze earnings call transcripts or tweets for stock sentiment.\n",
        "\n",
        " During product launches, a sudden sentiment drop can trigger PR responses, saving millions.\n",

        "**Binary Classification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Two classes: Positive vs. Negative.\n",
        "- Simpler, more robust, higher accuracy.\n",
        "- Example: IMDB movie reviews (pos/neg).\n",
        "- Best when neutral is rare or irrelevant.\n",

        "**Multi-class Classification:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Three or more classes: Positive, Negative, Neutral\n",
        "- More informative but harder (data imbalance, lower accuracy, needs more labeled data).\n",

        "\n",
        "Raw text is noisy (punctuation, capitalization, common words). Preprocessing standardizes it so models focus on meaningful signals.\n",
        "Standard Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Lowercasing: \"Great\" → \"great\" (reduces vocabulary size).\n",
        "2. Remove punctuation/numbers/URLs: \"Wow!!!\" → \"Wow\".\n",
        "3. Tokenization: Split into words/tokens.\n",
        "Example: \"I love NLP!\" → [\"I\", \"love\", \"NLP\"].\n",
        "4. Stopword Removal: Drop high-frequency, low-meaning words.\n",
        "\n",
        "*  English stopwords: \"the\", \"is\", \"and\", \"of\", \"to\".\n",
        "*  Example: \"the movie is great\" → \"movie great\".\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Stemming or Lemmatization:\n",
        "* Stemming: Rule-based chopping (Porter/Snowball). Fast but crude.\n",
        "\"running\", \"runner\", \"ran\" → \"run\".\n",
        "* Lemmatization: Context-aware (uses WordNet dictionary). Slower but accurate.\n",
        "\"running\" → \"run\", \"better\" → \"good\", \"mice\" → \"mouse\".\n",

        "## **d) Introduction to bag-of-words and TF-IDF representations**\n",

        "**Bag-of-Words (BoW):**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Simplest: Represent text as a vector of word counts (ignores order).\n",

        "Example corpus:\n",
        "Doc1: \"great movie\"\n",
        "Doc2: \"terrible movie\"\n",
